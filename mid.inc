          This is a website, created out of frustration with uncomplete and outdated Bitcoin Core RPC documentation online.
          </p>
          <p>
          It was inspired by <a href="http://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api">ChainQuery</a>, which seems to be abandoned. These docs are even simplier, so they can be regenerated by anyone.

          Note that the RPC is from a regtest node (for completeness), so it includes some additional calls that a regular node doesn't have.
